Right now, there are currently no confirmed plans for 𝚂trea𝚖ing The Monkey. As more cinemas open up and theater attendance continues to rise post-pandemic, simultaneous 𝚂trea𝚖ing and theater releases are becoming less common. However, if past titles are anything to go by, it’s a safe bet that Fury Of The Gods will join its DCEU siblings on within the next few months.
